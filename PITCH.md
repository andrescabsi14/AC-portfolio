"Imagine talking to your website." Imagine your clients or your users talking directly to your website and achieving whatever they want to achieve in seconds instead of minutes. Imagine having your own agent artificial intelligence agent that can resolve questions not by taking the users to the FAQs but to actually providing a valuable service even before meeting you and not only resolving questions but making immediate quotes, handle objections and even notify you when something is wrong, . I don't do websites. I don't do applications. I do something beyond that. I connect artificial intelligence with your website with your systems and make it easier for you and your users or clients to improve the communication that at the end results in increasing of sales and increasing of user satisfaction. This not only helps you to improve yourselves and your bottom line or top line, but actually it helps you to automate your business processes. What if you can trigger an automation as soon as a user or any of your clients confirms any purchase or even confirms to you that they want to hear about you? And you can just send immediately an analysis made by someone who may be any person of your team. Instead of promising the user or your client to receive it in two or three days, that you can send it automatically without any human intervention in a matter of minutes. Imagine how simple your life would be with these kinds of services and automations with this kind of solutions. My name is Andres Cabrera and I've been working as a software engineer for several of the most important companies on the planet. Thanks to that experience I can provide you with some of the most advanced technologies in the planet at a cost that you can pay. You don't have to worry about paying a lot for services that probably are over-engineered for you. In some cases we can even work based on your results and that is how confident I am of the solutions that I provide. That I can even guarantee you, that if you are not happy with your end results, I can give you your money back. You can save almost half of the time of your processes. And you can save thousands even hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first year of implementation of these solutions. But I'm not gonna lie: this is just not about plugging an artificial intelligence into your website and just taking off leaving you with a great technology but basically no integration at all with your business. I take it a little bit further than that because I know that for long-term results and to be AI-first, you need to be prepared and your business has to transition into a more efficient organization. That is why I am not interested in short-term relationships but actually I am looking forward to staying with you as a technological partner in the long run and that is one of our differences with other people or other solution providers of artificial intelligence. I'm not aiming to gain a contract and charge you. Just put the technology at your hands and that's it. I want you to take the best out of this technology and transform your life, your business, and the life of your employees and your clients. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to move forward to progress into a highly efficient and highly prosperous business and organization, and you have the keys in your hands to do this. You don't have to be a huge corporation to achieve this. You just have to believe in what you can do and let us care about the complexity of the technology because that is our specialty. Our specialty is to simplify what is usually the most complex technology on the planet for you to feel like it is really simple. You don't have to deal with complexity servers or any other complex system because that is our work. And you will never have to because we have engineered a program that will allow you to take advantage of the most benefits of this technology in a very simple step-by-step way. We are not going to ask you to transform your business from today to tomorrow because we are aware that this takes time and effort. But we are willing to be there with you and to help you in this transition. If you think that your business is worth living another 10 years, then you are the right fit for us and we are the right fit for you.

We are here to discover together what is best for your business and we are going to do it with incredible tools that will make your life easier. The best thing of this is that as you are implementing these tools, you are becoming you are acquiring a competitive advantage compared to your competitors.

We care about your business, we care about why you started your business, and we care about keeping that identity and that culture. That's something that makes your clients come back again to you. But not only that, we are capable and competent. We've been working with high-tech technology for the last 12 years. We even started to work in artificial intelligence back in 2016, and actually one of our founders, Andres Cabrera was recognized by President Barack Obama as a Young leaders of the Americas, an honor received thanks to his project to use airticial intelligence back in 2016 to treat patients with diseases and envision a future with predicitve medicine using AI to improve people's health.

Take this small step, we will take care of the next. Contact us via our 24/7 assistant and for limited time receive a complimentary analysis of your business and how you can implement artificial intelligence to save thousands of hours and hundred of thousands of dollars in costs and increase revenue by orders of magnitude."

Add subpages for industries and success cases to show them what they can do. For example for Lawn Care companies, Law offices, Medical practices, Dental Practices, Insurance offices, Labs, Pharma, HR tasks, remove paperwork and avoid that nighmare of paper that several business has, etc. My niche is small businesses with low hang fruit solutions, such us adding a chat with an agent in their website to automate lead intake, lead nurturing, conenction with CRM, finances and processes for their own clients and automate processes in general. It should have these little trick interfaces when you say, what is your biggest problematic process you have right now after showing this, showing just a line that doesn't even look like a text area. And receive a single response from the agent. It should just show the past line of conversation with opacity at the top in this section. The line should glow and invite to click. One single line to persuade the user to answer a simple question. For example the title of that section could be: "Discover what we can do for you...in seconds" and a subtitle "You don't believe me, try it:"

and a line glowing or titilando with a click here placeholder in light gray. Then as soon as the user clicks it, it should show the first question that i mentioned before. If the user doesn't respond anything in 1 minute, it should show a "you don't have anything to loose, try it, you will be amazed"

Theidea for tht specific section is to replace the traditional contact us, with a live agent that only gets activated when the usr type, and ask a few questions to the user and then it promises to send a recommendations free of cost, that they will not only can implement with us but with any provider, but telling them we know what we do and this. is just the surface, that we work had with hand with them to achieve extraordinary results.

Add any component section you think it make sense. Use shadcn, framer motion and any other animation to convey this message to the user and make them sign up via our AI assistant. The idea is to covert their businesses in AI first businesses. It has to look custom made, impressive as the first sections of the home page, but easy to read. They will listen to this pitch. This pitch has to show to them progressively. To keep the momentum, use framer motion and the scroll for the user to control what they see. Maybe even showing different images as they scroll and introduce several effects and see screenshots of solutions for the use cases section.

I want to include this as a section that I can reuse across the whole website for the contact section. Of course there is going to be a contact section as a pre-footer section and I want to save this and the idea is that the users can start interacting with this assistant agent that I have prepared for them. The message I want to transmit is:

"As you may imagine Andres is a really busy person that works daily with different types of businesses and that's why he has delegated to his AI assistant the responsibility to start the first interactions with their clients. He is so confident in these solutions that he is relying on critical parts of his business, for example getting in touch with their clients, the initial touch with their clients through these tools And he does this because he is aware of the importance of businesses and people behind businesses to start getting used to these kinds of interactions that with time are going to be more human-like This doesn't mean that Andres is not going to be in touch with you or is not going to be involved in the actual business of your business It is actually quite the opposite. By relying on me his assistant, you will be able to spend time that otherwise wouldn't be possible. And thanks to his preparation with me, he has coached me to become a really world-class advisor for you This is great because you are no longer limited by Andrés's time but instead you are going to be able to tell me what are the problems that you want to solve first. What is your situation? And I am going to listen to you very carefully. Together we are going to outline a plan that is going to be reviewed by Andrés and he is going to make sure that everything we say is right and we plan here is doable. After this I am going to help you schedule a call with Andrés to make sure that he can jump in a call not with just part of the story but with the whole story. Because I already help Andrés to understand the whole picture of you and your business in a matter of minutes. "

Improve the footer to include social links to social networks. Also, include in the footer some links to articles to resolve usual objections that users may have with articles. So, for example, instead of saying "the user I don't know 10 steps to do x, y, z", just mention the problem or the situation they may have and want to solve, and you can do this with a title about that situation per industry covering usually common challenges that the businesses may have, for example customer care, sales etc and categorize those links with those category titles in the footer. then below each category title an article of How to solve (problem/situation) in (time measure)

These articles are meant to be guides that will expand the vision of the user and it will allow the user to see what they can do with artificial intelligence and how these common problems can be solved easily with an artificial intelligence solution. For them to become AI-ready or AI-first companies The idea with these articles is to have a long hanging fruit for us to create a lead magnet that the users can click on and that they can become members of the communities that we have. In these articles, they can have really valuable valuable advice free advice on what they can do To generate the necessity for them to count with a really good partner that understands their business and that they can rely on to build a really fast and simple solution to solve that specific problem. Over time to become a technological partner that helps them to become AI-first or AI-ready

I have a page that I initially was going to be my portfolio for a developer. But instead I want to create a page for services for AI-first services for companies. What I want you to do is to keep the first section in the home page and the second section (the globe map for example). And create new sections with links to AI first page which is the page that I'm going to use to explain the users how we transform them into AI first companies And other sections that can take the user to basically contact us generating curiosity, then capture the attention of the user by mentioning several usual situations and mentioning the problems of those situations and the implications of not taking care of those problems using AI For example if they don't take care of those problems, not only their business would usually have problems, but in the era of AI, probably another competitor would take a huge advantage of using AI systems to overcome their market position and basically crush them And here we are to take care of that for them. To take off the complexity of these systems and to make it easier for them to make a really smooth transition into an AI-first company Include a section to an article to help them understand what is AI-first and how they can become easily in several easy steps an AI-first company

We are an AI integration company that provide services for businesses in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia to become AI first which means adopt AI revolutionary technologies to their current systems and channels, to save time and money, increase sales, reduce drastically time to process requirements and optimize processes, with solutions specially designed for them to get competitve advantage in their market and stay ahead of the competition.

Explain as well that I am operating under my name because I'm so confident of this result that I have put my name as a guarantee. It is not usual to listen to that in this era where you can basically fake anything. But I'm also so committed to this that I am putting my name, my reputation on the line to make sure that you progress and become an AI first company.
