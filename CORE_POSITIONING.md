## Key Questions We Answer

**"Is this just putting AI on my website?"**
No. That's part of it, but it's really about transforming how your business operates.

**"Will I understand what's happening?"**
Yes. We coach you through it step-by-step. Complexity is our job, not yours.

**"What if I'm not tech-savvy?"**
Perfect. We don't expect you to be. We handle the complexity and simplify it for you.

**"Can I implement this quickly?"**
Yes, but we don't rush. You set the pace. Some early wins come fast; full transformation takes thoughtful time.

**"What if you go out of business?"**
I'm operating under my name. My reputation and income depend on your success. That won't happen.

**"Can I use this with other providers?"**
Yes. We want you to own the transformation. But our deep integration and partnership approach means you probably won't want to.
